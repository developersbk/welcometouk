				<div class="contentz">
					<p>For
						International Transactions, please change your debit/credit card into VISA or Mastercard if your
						existing card is Rupay.</p>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>Accommodations</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p><strong>Things to know about house systems:</strong><br>
						Keep money saved for deposit (Usually 2 months rent amount is deposit plus the first month rent)
					</p>

					<p><strong>Types of House:</strong><br>
						<strong>1. Student Accommodations</strong><br>
						These are living spaces designed specifically for students, often located near universities or
						colleges. They can be private rooms or shared with other students. They may come with
						all-inclusive
						rent (including utilities, internet, etc.) and often feature communal spaces like kitchens,
						lounges,
						or study areas. Examples include dormitories, student flats, and purpose-built student
						apartments.
					</p>

					<p><strong>2. Studio</strong><br>
						A studio is a small, self-contained apartment. It typically consists of one room that combines
						the
						living, sleeping, and kitchen areas, with a separate bathroom. This type of accommodation is
						great
						for individuals who want privacy and prefer to live independently but don’t need a lot of space.
						It’s a common choice for young professionals or students in need of a compact living space.
					</p>

					<p><strong>3. Shared Houses</strong><br>
						This refers to a house that is shared by multiple people, typically with each person having
						their
						own bedroom but sharing common areas like the living room, kitchen, and bathroom. This
						arrangement
						is common among students, young professionals, or people who want to save on rent. Shared houses
						may
						come in various sizes, from smaller homes with just a few housemates to larger houses with many
						tenants.<br>
						Each type of accommodation caters to different needs and lifestyles.

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>International Driving License</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>If you already have a valid license in India, you can apply for an international driving license.
						The international driver's license is valid for one year from the date you enter the United
						Kingdom.
						You can drive a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler with adequate insurance and either own or rent the
						vehicle.<br>
						By the time the validity period expires, try to obtain a valid UK license so that you can
						continue
						driving beyond one year.</p>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>Parcel Service to UK</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>It is preferable to package common nonfragile items to the UK if you already have a reliable
						person
						in UK rather than wasting a lot of money on airline luggage. To obtain a quote for the package,
						kindly locate a local-to-international postal service station.</p>
					<p>Examples : FedEx International, DHL, International Express Post <br>

					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>Indian Sim Card</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>Since it would be a waste of money to install and maintain an international pack, there is no
						need
						to bring the Indian SIM card here. It's not worth it. Please get another SIM card specifically
						for
						use at the airport and abroad. You can also open and keep another bank account specifically for
						use
						abroad. Since you may have already connected your official documents to your current SIM card,
						it
						would be best to keep it in India with your family or another trustworthy person to avoid having
						it
						blocked in the future.</p>
					<p>To convert an Indian SIM card to an eSIM, you can typically send an SMS to your network
						provider's
						designated number with the keyword "eSIM" followed by your registered email address, which will
						then
						send you a QR code to scan on your phone to activate the eSIM. Most major Indian providers like
						Airtel, Jio, and Vi support this process, and you should check your specific carrier's
						instructions
						for exact details.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>Cash Withdrawal in Pounds</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>Until your bank account is set up, cash is primarily required for travel, accommodation rent,
						grocery expenses, and mobile recharge. Therefore, it's safe to take out about £500 when you get
						to
						the UK. Avoid using top-up debit cards or forex cards since you will only be able to use that
						card
						to spend the remaining balance. Money cannot be transferred or withdrawn without paying taxes.
						Therefore, it is preferable to withdraw and keep the pounds.<br>
						BEWARE of cash being stolen while living in sharing on entering UK because it has happened a
						lot.
						<br>SO KEEP IT SAFE!
					</p>
					<p>Use airport Money Exchange for emergency:<br>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>International Adapter</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>You can use an international adapter if you want to utilize your gadgets here, however the
						devices
						might not last long because of the voltage difference. Therefore, avoid purchasing phones or
						laptops
						before traveling to the UK, as you will have dependable contracts once you arrive. Therefore,
						save
						money and purchase it once you're in the UK. Use a high-quality, professional, international
						adaptor
						if you have already purchased one.<br>

				<div class="contentz">

						all
						over the world. Don't buy phones, laptops, or jackets from India, you will get better ones here.
						The
						list of items to purchase from India will be explained below.</p>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>Bed Bugs in Homes</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>Bed bugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on human blood, often hiding in mattresses,
						furniture,
						and cracks in walls. They spread through luggage, clothing, and second-hand furniture, making
						hotels and shared
						accommodations common hotspots. Regularly inspect and vacuum bedding, furniture, and carpets to
						catch infestations
						early. Use protective mattress covers and wash bedding at high temperatures to kill any hidden
						bugs. Be cautious
						when buying second-hand furniture and consider professional pest control if an infestation
						occurs.</p>
					<p>Prevention: Neem Oil, Repellent, Peppermint<br>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>OTT Accounts</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<p>OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hotstar offer region-specific content,
						meaning the
						library available in India may differ from what you get in the UK. Most subscriptions remain
						valid internationally,
						but some services may require a change in payment method or address based on your new location.
						Netflix and Amazon
						Prime (some of it) allow you to use the same account globally, but your content selection will
						depend on the
						country's licensing agreements. Disney+ Hotstar is not available in the UK, so you may need to
						subscribe to Disney+
						and Hotstar separately in the UK, and your Indian Hotstar subscription does not work.<br>
						There are <strong>YuppTV</strong> and <strong>ChithramTV</strong> for Indian television shows
						and movies, which is
						also an alternative.<br><br>
						Its good to take the <strong>LinkedIn Premium</strong> from India itself as its expensive in UK.
						You can use the
						same account globally with Indian payments.

						could lead to severe legal consequences. If you carry prescription medication, ensure you have a
						prescription and check if the medication is allowed in the UK.</p>

					<p><strong>Restricted Items:</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Liquids and Gels:</strong> As per aviation security, liquids, gels, and aerosols in

						Force. Certain milk and cheese products may be restricted depending on their origin and content.

						currencies
						(including Indian Rupees) without declaring it. If you're carrying more than this amount, you
						must
						declare it to customs.</p>
					<p><strong>Gold and Jewelry:</strong> You can bring in gold jewelry for personal use. However,
						bringing
						large amounts of gold or gold bullion may attract attention from customs.</p>

					<p><strong>Special Items (Gifts and Souvenirs):</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Gifts and Souvenirs:</strong> Personal items, gifts, and souvenirs are usually allowed as
						long as they fall within the personal use limits. However, you may need to declare items if they
						exceed the value limits or quantity restrictions (e.g., excessive alcohol or tobacco).</p>
					</p>
					<p><strong>2. Newly Bought Items</strong><br>
						Newly bought items, such as clothing, shoes, or accessories, are generally allowed in carry-on
						bags.
						However, you may need to declare items if they exceed the value limits or quantity
						restrictions.<br>
						Also, Its safe to take the electronics(like laptops, ipad, mobiles, tablets) out of the original
						box
						and carry them in your hand luggage as with the mint box, they ll find it suspicious for
						resale.<br>

						are
						allowed to bring in
						up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, or 2 litres of spirits or a combination of these,
						provided the total volume doesn't exceed the limits for personal use.<br>
						<strong>Duty-Free:</strong> If you're flying directly from India to the UK, you can purchase

						duty-free, but
						you still need to adhere to the quantity limits including the goods inside the luggage. If you
						exceed the limit, you may be required to pay duty and tax.<br>

					<p><strong>A. Prescription Medicines:</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Carrying Prescription Medication:</strong> If you're carrying prescription medicines, you
						must have a valid prescription from a doctor. The prescription should ideally be in English to
						avoid
						complications at customs.</p>
					<p><strong>Personal Use Only:</strong> The medications should be for personal use. Carrying
						excessive
						quantities may raise suspicions that the medicine is for distribution or sale.</p>
					<p><strong>Controlled Medicines:</strong> Some medications available in India may be classified as
						controlled substances in the UK. Examples include certain painkillers, sedatives, or
						anti-anxiety
						medications. These may require additional documentation, such as a letter from your doctor or a
						copy
						of your prescription.</p>

					<p><strong>B. Controlled Drugs:</strong></p>
					<p>The UK has strict laws regarding controlled drugs, including certain narcotics, sedatives, or
						stimulants. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Opioid-based painkillers like codeine, morphine, or tramadol.</li>
						<li>Benzodiazepines like diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you need to carry these medications, you will likely need an export certificate (also called a
						"license to import controlled drugs"). This can be obtained from the UK's Home Office before you
						travel.</p>
					<p><strong>Declare to Customs:</strong> You must declare controlled drugs at customs if you have
						them in
						your possession. Not declaring them could lead to severe legal consequences.</p>

					<p><strong>C. Over-the-Counter Medications:</strong></p>
					<p>Medications like paracetamol, ibuprofen, or basic antihistamines are generally not a problem if
						they
						are for personal use and in reasonable quantities.</p>
					<p>However, if you’re carrying larger quantities, you might need to show proof that it’s for
						personal
						use.</p>

					<p><strong>D. Medicine in Original Packaging:</strong></p>
					<p>Always carry your medications in their original packaging with clear labeling to avoid issues
						during
						inspections. If possible, keep the packaging and your prescription or doctor's note together.
					</p>

					<p><strong>E. Special Restrictions for Certain Substances:</strong></p>
					<p>The UK has specific restrictions on some substances, like certain herbal or alternative
						medicines.
						Cannabis-based products and substances that are legal in India might be controlled or illegal in
						the
						UK, even if prescribed by a doctor in India.</p>
					<p><strong>Cannabis-based Medicines:</strong> While certain cannabis-based medicines are allowed in
						the
						UK, they require a specific prescription from a UK doctor. If you're carrying any cannabis-based
						product, make sure you have a doctor’s prescription and the product is licensed in the UK.</p>

					<p><strong>F. Medications and Airport Security:</strong></p>
					<p>When passing through security at airports, all medications are allowed in your carry-on luggage,
						but
						you must declare them to airport security. If the medication is liquid, it may be subject to the
						usual liquid restrictions (usually, liquids over 100ml are not allowed in carry-on bags unless
						necessary for medical reasons).</p>
					<p><strong>Documentation for Liquids and Needles:</strong> If you carry liquid medication, syringes,
						or
						needles (for insulin or other medical needs), you may be required to show a doctor's note
						explaining
						the necessity for the medical items.</p>

						Check-in online (if you haven't): If you've already checked in online, proceed directly to the
						baggage drop counter to hand over your checked bags.</p>

					<p><strong>2. Baggage Check</strong><br>
						Drop off checked luggage: If you have checked luggage, hand it over at the airline's designated
						counter. You’ll receive a baggage tag for each piece of luggage.<br>
						Confirm baggage weight: Ensure that your checked baggage complies with the airline’s weight
						limit to
						avoid extra charges. (If you have already any address in the UK of your friends or relatives,
						Then I
						advise you to parcel the non breaking things to the address and reduce the price of your flight
						tickets with less luggage)</p>

					<p><strong>3. Security Check</strong><br>
						After check-in, proceed to security screening. Here, you'll need to remove your shoes, belt, and
						any
						metal items, and place them in a tray for inspection.<br>
						Electronics: Laptops, tablets, other large electronics, Jackets, overcoats, belts and sometimes
						shoes should be taken out of your bag for
						scanning.<br>
						Liquids: Make sure any liquids are in containers of 100 ml or less, and packed in a transparent
						plastic bag or else they ll throw them in the bin without asking(following the airline’s rules).
					</p>

					<p><strong>4. Immigration and Passport Control</strong><br>
						For international flights, go to the immigration counter after clearing security. You’ll need to
						show your passport, visa (if required), and boarding pass.<br>
						The officer will stamp your passport for departure from India.</p>

					<p><strong>5. Find Your Gate</strong><br>
						After clearing immigration, check the flight information boards for your gate number and
						departure
						time.<br>
						Check your boarding pass to confirm the gate and any additional information.</p>

					<p><strong>6. Currency Exchange (If Needed)</strong><br>
						If you need British Pounds or other foreign currencies, you can visit a currency exchange
						counter in
						the airport. (Keep atleast 500 pounds as cash until you get a Bank card after getting into
						UK)<br>
						Alternatively, consider using an international debit/credit card for purchases at the airport or
						upon arrival in the UK.</p>

					<p><strong>7. Duty-Free Shopping</strong><br>
						After passing through immigration, you can visit the duty-free shops to buy perfumes, cosmetics,
						alcohol, chocolates, and other products.<br>
						Duty-free shopping allows you to purchase items without paying the usual taxes or duties.</p>

					<p><strong>8. Grab Some Food/Drinks</strong><br>
						Restaurants and cafes: Airport terminals have plenty of food and drink options. It's a good time
						to
						have a meal or a light snack before your flight, especially since long flights to the UK might
						not
						provide a full meal soon after takeoff.</p>

					<p><strong>9. Stay Updated on Your Flight</strong><br>
						Regularly check the flight information screens to ensure there are no changes to your flight’s
						gate
						or departure time.<br>
						Listen for any boarding announcements or changes.</p>

					<p><strong>10. Relax and Wait for Boarding</strong><br>
						Once you've completed all the steps above, find a comfortable spot near the gate or in the
						designated seating area for passengers traveling on international flights.<br>
						Use this time to relax, read, or even use airport Wi-Fi if available.</p>

					<p><strong>11. Boarding</strong><br>
						About 45 minutes to an hour before departure, boarding will begin. Make sure you're at the gate
						and
						ready with your boarding pass and passport in hand.<br>
						Follow the instructions from the airline staff to board the plane when your group is called.</p>

					<p><strong>Enjoy the Flight!</strong><br></p>

					<p><strong><a

					<p>A <strong>share code</strong> is a unique code used to prove your immigration status or right to
						work
						or rent in the UK. The code is part of the UK’s digital immigration system, and it is used when
						you
						need to share your status with an employer, landlord, or other organizations.</p>

					<p>The share code is generated from the UK government’s online system and allows third parties to
						check
						your immigration status without needing to see your physical documents.</p>

					<p><strong>What is the Share Code Used For?</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Right to Work:</strong> Employers can use the share code to verify that you are

							the
							share code.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>To get a share code, you will need to have a UK immigration status that is recorded digitally,
						such
						as a <strong>Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)</strong>, a <strong>UK Visa</strong>, or
						<strong>EU
							Settlement Scheme status</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>Here are the steps to get a share code:</p>

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Log into the Government Website:</strong><br>Visit the UK Government’s Immigration
							Status Check page.(Link provided above)</li>
						<li><strong>Sign In:</strong><br>If you’re applying for a share code, you will need to sign in

							number.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Request a Share Code:</strong><br>Follow the instructions on the website to generate
							a
							share code. You’ll be asked for your details to confirm your identity.</li>
						<li><strong>Share the Code:</strong><br>Once the code is generated, you’ll receive the share
							code.
							You can then share it with the person or organization that needs to verify your immigration
							status.</li>
						<li><strong>Validity:</strong><br>The share code is typically valid for 30 days, so make sure to
							use
							it within that timeframe.</li>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>VISIT UNIVERSITY FIRST</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<br>
					<p><strong>VISIT UNIVERSITY FOR STUDENT REGISTRATION, ENROLMENT, NATIONAL INSURANCE AND LETTER FOR
							YOUR
							BANK REGISTRATION</strong></p>
					<p><strong>1. Visit University for Student Details and Enrollment</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Student Registration:</strong> After arriving in the UK, one of the first things you
						should
						do is visit your university to complete your registration process. This usually involves
						confirming
						your identity, providing any additional documents (like your passport, visa, etc.), and
						confirming
						your course details.</p>
					<p><strong>Enrolment:</strong> You will officially enroll in your course at the university, which
						might
						require you to sign documents, pay any remaining fees (if applicable), and get your student ID.
						This
						step is essential as it confirms your status as a student at the university.</p>

					<p><strong>2. Attend Classes and Get Academic Information</strong></p>
					<p>Once you’ve completed your enrollment, you will begin attending your classes as per your
						timetable.
						Make sure to familiarize yourself with the university campus, the location of your classes, and
						any
						other academic requirements, such as course materials or online portals.</p>
					<p>Your university will also provide you with information about academic expectations, such as
						attendance policies, assessment methods, and support services available to international
						students.
					</p>

					<p><strong>3. National Insurance (NI) Registration</strong></p>
					<p><strong>What is National Insurance?</strong> National Insurance (NI) is a system in the UK where
						workers and employers contribute to social security, which funds public services like healthcare
						(NHS), pensions, and unemployment benefits.</p>
					<p><strong>Why is NI Important for Students?</strong> As an international student, you’ll need a
						National Insurance number if you plan to work while studying (part-time jobs or internships, for
						example). You’ll need to provide your NI number to your employer when you start working.</p>
					<p><strong>How to Apply for National Insurance Number:</strong> You can apply for your National
						Insurance number online or by phone, depending on your circumstances. Usually, the university’s
						student services office can provide you with more details or assist you in the application
						process.
					</p>
					<p>Note that you must have the right to work in the UK (as specified by your student visa) to be
						eligible to receive an NI number.</p>

					<p><strong>4. Letter for Bank Registration in the UK</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Opening a UK Bank Account:</strong> To manage your finances while studying in the UK, you
						will likely need a UK bank account. This is essential for receiving funds, paying bills, and
						managing day-to-day expenses.</p>
					<p><strong>Required Documents for Opening a Bank Account:</strong> Most banks in the UK will require
						proof of your identity, proof of address, and proof of student status. The university typically
						provides a student confirmation letter or a letter of enrollment, which serves as proof that you
						are
						officially enrolled and studying at the university.</p>
					<p>This letter is essential when registering with a bank to open a UK account. Some universities
						provide
						these letters for free or can assist you in getting one. It’s advisable to check with your
						university’s international student office about how to obtain this letter.</p>

					<p><strong>5. Other Key Points to Remember</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Student ID:</strong> Keep your student ID safe, as it may be needed for various
						university
						services, accessing libraries, and getting discounts on public transportation.</p>
					<p><strong>Health Registration (NHS):</strong> If you're eligible, make sure you're registered with
						the
						NHS for healthcare access while you're in the UK.</p>
					<p><strong>Student Support Services:</strong> Most universities offer support for international
						students, including orientation programs, counseling, and visa guidance. Don’t hesitate to ask
						for
						assistance if needed.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>BEWARE OF NI SCAMS</strong>
				</button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<br>
					<p>Beware of scams targeting international students who may be asked to pay additional fees for
						National
						Insurance (NI) registration. Once you have paid your visa fees and received the appropriate
						working
						rights, you do not need to pay any additional fees for NI registration.</p>
					<p>The registration for National Insurance is free. You only need to register to obtain your NI
						number,
						which is required if you plan to work while studying. If someone asks you to pay for the
						registration or makes it seem like a chargeable service, be very cautious and report it
						immediately.
					</p>
					<p>Never share personal details or pay for services that are supposed to be free. Only use the
						official
						government website or contact the university's student services if you need assistance with your
						NI
						registration.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>REGISTER FOR MEDICAL SERVICES</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<br>

					<p>It is important to register with a <strong> local GP (General Practice)</strong> as soon as you
						arrive in the UK. This
						will ensure you have access to free healthcare services through the <strong>NHS (National Health
							Service).</strong>
					</p>
					<p>By registering with the GP, you will be able to see a doctor when needed, receive prescriptions,
						and
						access other healthcare services without incurring any costs, as long as you are eligible for
						NHS
						services. Make sure to bring proof of your address and student status when registering.</p>
					<p><strong>You can also register with your university, which may provide additional assistance with
							the
							registration process.</strong></p>
					<p>Find a GP local to your area and make an appointment for free NHS services. (Some critical
						appointments are done through NHS App services too)</p>

					<p>NOTE: Medicines and Prescriptions are to be paid with our own expenses unless you are medically
						exempt.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>TAKE ID WITH YOU</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<br>
					<p><strong>ACCEPTABLE IDENTIFICATION : PROVISIONAL LICENSE, PASSPORT, DRIVING LICENSE(UK),
							STUDENT ID</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Proof of Identity and Age:</strong> Whether you're entering a bar, buying age-restricted
						items like alcohol or tobacco, or simply traveling, your ID proves who you are and that you are
						legally allowed to participate in certain activities. It’s especially important if you’re under
						18
						or 21, as many places will require age verification.</p>

					<p><strong>Traveling Around:</strong> Public transportation services in the UK may require you to
						show
						your ID, particularly if you're using discounted fares available to students or young people. A
						student ID or a National Railcard can also be useful for discounted travel.</p>

					<p><strong>Access to Services:</strong> You may be asked for identification when accessing
						healthcare,
						registering for a bank account, or using other services. For example, your university may
						request to
						see your ID to confirm your identity or grant access to certain facilities.</p>

					<p><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> If you find yourself in an emergency or needing
						assistance,
						having your ID with you can help the authorities or healthcare professionals quickly locate your
						details and provide appropriate help.</p>

					<p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In some situations, carrying ID is a legal requirement,
						especially if you're involved in a situation where authorities need to verify your identity
						(such as
						during a police stop or in a situation requiring you to show proof of immigration status).</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>CONTRACTLESS ROOMS NOTICE</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz">
					<br>

					<p>In the context of housing or student accommodation, contractless rooms refer to rooms that do not
						have a formal lease or rental agreement. Typically, these rooms are provided on a more temporary
						basis, and tenants are not bound by a long-term contract.</p>

					<p>If you are staying in a room without a formal contract, it's important to be aware that
						<strong>you may be
							asked to leave at any time</strong>, especially when the accommodation provider needs the
						room for other
						purposes or when your temporary stay comes to an end.
					</p>

					<p>Always clarify the terms of your stay to understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong> UK BANK ACCOUNT</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz"><br>
					<p>When you're setting up a UK bank account as an international student or new resident, there are
						certain steps you need to follow. One of the primary requirements is to provide proof of your
						student status or residence. A letter from your university, confirming that you're enrolled and
						attending, serves as this proof.</p>

					<p><strong>Why Do You Need a Letter from the University/Employer?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Proof of Student Status:</strong> The letter from your university/employer confirms your
						enrollment
						and shows that you are a legitimate student/employee. Most banks require this document to verify
						that you are
						eligible to open a personal bank account or a student bank account, which may offer benefits
						such as fee waivers or discounted
						banking services.</p>

					<p><strong>Proof of Address:</strong> In some cases, universities provide a letter that also
						confirms
						your UK address, which is another requirement for opening a bank account. Alternatively, a
						utility
						bill, tenancy agreement, or letter from your landlord can also work as proof of address.</p>

					<p><strong>Direct Bank Visit for Faster Service</strong></p>
					<p>While many banks offer the option of applying for an account online, a direct visit to the bank
						is
						often more efficient and faster, especially for international students. It also ensures that the
						process runs smoothly and that you have immediate access to your new account.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS</strong></button>
				<div class="contentz"><br>

					<p>Contactless payment like Apple Pay or Google Pay or contactless bank card allows you to pay for
						items by simply tapping your card or smartphone near a
						payment terminal, without having to insert your card or enter a PIN (for small amounts). The
						payment
						is processed through near-field communication (NFC) technology. Enable the NFC feature on
						android
						phones and pay with it. For iphones, It's default enabled.</p>

					<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Contactless Cards or Devices:</strong></p>

					<p>It’s everywhere: You can use contactless payments in almost every shop, restaurant, and public
						transport.</p>

					<p><strong>Bank Cards:</strong> If you have a UK bank card (debit or credit card) that supports
						contactless payments, it will have the contactless symbol on it (a wavy line or a small wave
						symbol).</p>

					<p><strong>Smartphones:</strong> You can also use Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone to make
						contactless payments. You’ll link your UK bank card to your phone, and then use it to tap and
						pay.
					</p>

					<p><strong>Making Payments:</strong></p>

					<p><strong>In Stores:</strong> When you go to a shop or cafe, the payment terminal will display a
						contactless symbol. Simply tap your card or phone on the terminal to make a payment.</p>

					<p>How much can you spend? For payments under £100, you usually won’t need to enter a PIN. For
						amounts
						over £100, you may need to enter your PIN.</p>

					<p><strong>Phone or Watch:</strong> If you’re using Apple Pay or Google Pay, unlock your phone (or
						smartwatch) and hold it near the contactless reader. You may need to authenticate the payment
						using
						Face ID, Touch ID, or a PIN.</p>

					<p><strong>Public Transport:</strong> If you’re traveling around London, you can use contactless
						payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a contactless bank card) to pay for your journey on buses,
						trains, and the Tube. Just tap your card or phone on the reader when entering and exiting.</p>

				<button class="collapsible"><strong>STUDENT & NHS DISCOUNTS</strong></button>
