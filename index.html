				<p>Change your debit/credit card into VISA or Mastercard if your existing card is Rupay for

				<p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p>

				<p>Things to know about house systems:<br>
					Keep money saved for deposit (Usually 2 months rent amount is deposit plus the first month rent)
				</p>

				<p>Types of House:<br>

					1. Student Accommodations
					These are living spaces designed specifically for students, often located near universities or
					colleges. They can be private rooms or shared with other students. They may come with all-inclusive
					rent (including utilities, internet, etc.) and often feature communal spaces like kitchens, lounges,
					or study areas. Examples include dormitories, student flats, and purpose-built student apartments.
				</p>

				<p>2. Studio<br>
					A studio is a small, self-contained apartment. It typically consists of one room that combines the
					living, sleeping, and kitchen areas, with a separate bathroom. This type of accommodation is great
					for individuals who want privacy and prefer to live independently but don’t need a lot of space.
					It’s a common choice for young professionals or students in need of a compact living space.</p>

				<p>3. Shared Houses<br>
					This refers to a house that is shared by multiple people, typically with each person having their
					own bedroom but sharing common areas like the living room, kitchen, and bathroom. This arrangement
					is common among students, young professionals, or people who want to save on rent. Shared houses may
					come in various sizes, from smaller homes with just a few housemates to larger houses with many
					tenants.<br>
					Each type of accommodation caters to different needs and lifestyles.<br></p>

				<p><strong>International Driving License</strong></p>
				<p>If you already have a valid license in India, you can apply for an international driving license.
					The international driver's license is valid for one year from the date you enter the United Kingdom.
					You can drive a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler with adequate insurance and either own or rent the
					vehicle.<br>
					By the time the validity period expires, try to obtain a valid UK license so that you can continue
					driving beyond one year.</p>

				</p>

				<p><strong>Parcel Service to known person</strong></p>
				<p>It is preferable to package common nonfragile items to the UK if you already have a reliable person
					in UK rather than wasting a lot of money on airline luggage. To obtain a quote for the package,
					kindly locate a local-to-international postal service station.</p>
				<p>Examples : FedEx International, DHL, International Express Post <br>
					<a
						href="https://nimbuspost.com/uk/blog/best-courier-services-from-india-to-the-uk/">https://nimbuspost.com/uk/blog/best-courier-services-from-india-to-the-uk/</a>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Indian Sim Card</strong></p>
				<p>Since it would be a waste of money to install and maintain an international pack, there is no need
					to bring the Indian SIM card here. It's not worth it. Please get another SIM card specifically for
					use at the airport and abroad. You can also open and keep another bank account specifically for use
					abroad. Since you may have already connected your official documents to your current SIM card, it
					would be best to keep it in India with your family or another trustworthy person to avoid having it
					blocked in the future.</p>
				<p>To convert an Indian SIM card to an eSIM, you can typically send an SMS to your network provider's
					designated number with the keyword "eSIM" followed by your registered email address, which will then
					send you a QR code to scan on your phone to activate the eSIM. Most major Indian providers like
					Airtel, Jio, and Vi support this process, and you should check your specific carrier's instructions
					for exact details.</p>

				<p><strong>Cash Withdrawal in Pounds</strong></p>
				<p>Until your bank account is set up, cash is primarily required for travel, accommodation rent,
					grocery expenses, and mobile recharge. Therefore, it's safe to take out about £500 when you get to
					the UK. Avoid using top-up debit cards or forex cards since you will only be able to use that card
					to spend the remaining balance. Money cannot be transferred or withdrawn without paying taxes.
					Therefore, it is preferable to withdraw and keep the pounds.<br>
					BEWARE of cash being stolen while living in sharing on entering UK because it has happened a lot.
					<br>SO KEEP IT SAFE!
				</p>
				<p>Use airport Money Exchange for emergency:<br>

						href="https://www.xe.com/en-gb/currencyconverter/">https://www.xe.com/en-gb/currencyconverter/</a>
				</p>

				<p><strong>International Adapter</strong></p>
				<p>You can use an international adapter if you want to utilize your gadgets here, however the devices
					might not last long because of the voltage difference. Therefore, avoid purchasing phones or laptops
					before traveling to the UK, as you will have dependable contracts once you arrive. Therefore, save
					money and purchase it once you're in the UK. Use a high-quality, professional, international adaptor
					if you have already purchased one.<br>

				</p>

				<p><strong>Things you can take in flight</strong><br></p>
				<p>Bringing spices, coconut oil, or kitchenware in your flight luggage is not a problem. It is advised
					to pack solely Indian items in your suitcase rather than any common commodities that are sold all
					over the world. Don't buy phones, laptops, or jackets from India, you will get better ones here. The
					list of items to purchase from India will be explained below.</p>

				<p><strong>Things to Take especially from India</strong></p>
				<p>Bathroom Napthalenes, Belt, Brush, ToothPaste(Expensive in UK), Computer Glasses, Containers,
					Hangers,
					Induction Stove, Inflatable Bed, Kerchiefs, Laptop Bag, Lock & Keys, Medical Kit (Medicines, Cough
					syrup, All types of common disease medications), Nail Cutter, OTG & USB Cable, Pakkad, Peeler, Pen
					Drive, Ball Pens, Plate, Glass, Spices, Spoons, Powerbank, Purse/Wallet, Ropes, Sandals, Shampoo &
					Deo,
					Shaving Kit, Clothes (Shirt, Pants, Summer Clothes), Foam Base Shoes, Soap (Bath & Wash), Sun
					Glasses, Towel, Umbrella, Utensils.<br><br>

				<p><strong>Resume for Part Time Jobs (ATS)</strong></p>
				<p>Change your past education from specific places to India. For example, Anna University, India or
					HSC, India with percentage. Mention your VISA Status. Mention clearly about International Driving
					License if you have. Make your resume ATS friendly. Please research on the web about ATS friendly
					resumes.<br><br>

				<p><strong>Bed Bugs in Homes</strong></p>
				<p>Bed bugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on human blood, often hiding in mattresses,
					furniture, and cracks in walls. They spread through luggage, clothing, and second-hand furniture,
					making hotels and shared accommodations common hotspots. Regularly inspect and vacuum bedding,
					furniture, and carpets to catch infestations early. Use protective mattress covers and wash bedding
					at high temperatures to kill any hidden bugs. Be cautious when buying second-hand furniture and
					consider professional pest control if an infestation occurs.</p>
				<p>Prevention : Neem Oil, Repellent, Peppermint<br>

				</p>

				<p><strong>OTT Accounts (Amazon, Netflix, Disney, Hotstar)</strong></p>
				<p>OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hotstar offer region-specific content, meaning
					the library available in India may differ from what you get in the UK. Most subscriptions remain
					valid internationally, but some services may require a change in payment method or address based on
					your new location. Netflix and Amazon Prime (some of it) allow you to use the same account globally,
					but your content selection will depend on the country's licensing agreements. Disney+ Hotstar is not
					available in the UK, so you may need to subscribe to Disney+ and Hotstar separately in the UK, and
					your Indian Hotstar subscription does not work.<br>
					There are <strong>YuppTV</strong> and <strong>ChithramTV</strong> for Indian television shows and
					movies, which is also an
					alternative.<br><br>
					Its good to take the <strong>LinkedIn Premium</strong> from India itself as its expensive in UK. You
					can use the same account globally with Indian payments.

				<p><strong>How to book flights in UK</strong></p>
				<p>To book flight tickets in the UK, start by choosing a platform such as an online travel agency (like
					Skyscanner or Booking.com) or an airline's official website.<br>
				Enter your travel details, including departure and arrival locations, dates, and passenger
					information, and search for flights.<br>
				Browse through the available options, select the best flight for your schedule and budget, and
					provide your personal details.<br>
				Choose any additional options like baggage or seat selection, and then make the payment using a
					credit card, debit card(VISA or Mastercard for International transactions), or other methods.<br>
				After confirmation, you’ll receive your ticket via email and can check in online closer to your
					departure date.<br><br>

				Flight Booking Websites:<br>
				<a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a><br>
				<a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a><br>
				<a href="https://hopper.com/">Hopper</a><br></p>

				<p><strong>In the Airport</strong></p>
				<p><strong>1. Check In</strong><br>
					Head to the check-in counter: If you haven't checked in online, go to the airline's check-in desk.
					For international flights, you'll need to show your passport, visa (if required), and flight
					details.<br>
					Check-in online (if you haven't): If you've already checked in online, proceed directly to the
					baggage drop counter to hand over your checked bags.</p>

				<p><strong>2. Baggage Check</strong><br>
					Drop off checked luggage: If you have checked luggage, hand it over at the airline's designated
					counter. You’ll receive a baggage tag for each piece of luggage.<br>
					Confirm baggage weight: Ensure that your checked baggage complies with the airline’s weight limit to
					avoid extra charges. (If you have already any address in the UK of your friends or relatives, Then I
					advise you to parcel the non breaking things to the address and reduce the price of your flight
					tickets with less luggage)</p>

				<p><strong>3. Security Check</strong><br>
					After check-in, proceed to security screening. Here, you'll need to remove your shoes, belt, and any
					metal items, and place them in a tray for inspection.<br>
					Electronics: Laptops, tablets, other large electronics, Jackets, overcoats, belts and sometimes
					shoes should be taken out of your bag for
					scanning.<br>
					Liquids: Make sure any liquids are in containers of 100 ml or less, and packed in a transparent
					plastic bag or else they ll throw them in the bin without asking(following the airline’s rules).</p>

				<p><strong>4. Immigration and Passport Control</strong><br>
					For international flights, go to the immigration counter after clearing security. You’ll need to
					show your passport, visa (if required), and boarding pass.<br>
					The officer will stamp your passport for departure from India.</p>

				<p><strong>5. Find Your Gate</strong><br>
					After clearing immigration, check the flight information boards for your gate number and departure
					time.<br>
					Check your boarding pass to confirm the gate and any additional information.</p>

				<p><strong>6. Currency Exchange (If Needed)</strong><br>
					If you need British Pounds or other foreign currencies, you can visit a currency exchange counter in
					the airport. (Keep atleast 500 pounds as cash until you get a Bank card after getting into UK)<br>
					Alternatively, consider using an international debit/credit card for purchases at the airport or
					upon arrival in the UK.</p>

				<p><strong>7. Duty-Free Shopping</strong><br>
					After passing through immigration, you can visit the duty-free shops to buy perfumes, cosmetics,
					alcohol, chocolates, and other products.<br>
					Duty-free shopping allows you to purchase items without paying the usual taxes or duties.</p>

				<p><strong>8. Grab Some Food/Drinks</strong><br>
					Restaurants and cafes: Airport terminals have plenty of food and drink options. It's a good time to
					have a meal or a light snack before your flight, especially since long flights to the UK might not
					provide a full meal soon after takeoff.</p>

				<p><strong>9. Stay Updated on Your Flight</strong><br>
					Regularly check the flight information screens to ensure there are no changes to your flight’s gate
					or departure time.<br>
					Listen for any boarding announcements or changes.</p>

				<p><strong>10. Relax and Wait for Boarding</strong><br>
					Once you've completed all the steps above, find a comfortable spot near the gate or in the
					designated seating area for passengers traveling on international flights.<br>
					Use this time to relax, read, or even use airport Wi-Fi if available.</p>

				<p><strong>11. Boarding</strong><br>
					About 45 minutes to an hour before departure, boarding will begin. Make sure you're at the gate and
					ready with your boarding pass and passport in hand.<br>
					Follow the instructions from the airline staff to board the plane when your group is called.</p>

				<p><strong>12. Enjoy the Flight!</strong><br></p>

				<p><strong>VISA PROCESS</strong></p>
				<p>To apply for a UK student visa, first ensure you have been accepted into a UK-based educational institution and received a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).<br>
				Next, gather the required documents, such as proof of funds(Loan statements, bank statements with that required amount, Fixed deposit documents), passport, academic qualifications, and English language proficiency(IELTS, TOEFL, UK NARIC(For Professional Course graduates)).<br>
				Apply online through the UK government’s official website and pay the visa fee.<br>
				After submitting your application, you’ll need to attend a biometric appointment for fingerprint and photograph submission.<br>
				While waiting for your visa decision, keep track of any updates on your application, and use the time to prepare for your travel, such as booking flights, arranging accommodation, and reviewing your study plans.</p>
